- in the dA encoder, instead get the {0,1}(binary) encoded features, get the
origin float feature.
-get the result of :
	1. _uniq: before encoding, erase all the features of all-zeros, getting a
	lower dimension before the encoding.(sample rate_0.02)
	2. _tanh: use the tanh, other than sigmoid as the encoding function
